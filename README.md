# group7-visualisation


#We decided to brainstorm some topics we would be interested in and that could potentially add value to the class as well. 
After a quick brainstorming session, we implemented voting by preferences and came up with our three major themes; 
Finally we Start up and Acquisition as our broad topic, with a more narrow focus on the recent trends in Venture development and acquisitions. We will further limit the scope of research as soon as we ICe the data and see what kind of datasets we will be able to obtain(e.g. geographical limitations etc..)
We will import data from the following sources: Crunchbase, Kaggle, Data.gov.UK

Regarding the methods we will use, we will use a combination of models and exploratory analysis to visualise the data in the most efficient and meaninful way to communicate and convey our message.
